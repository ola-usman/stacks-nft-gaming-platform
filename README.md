# Stacks NFT Gaming Platform Smart Contract

## Overview

The Stacks NFT Gaming Platform is a comprehensive blockchain-based gaming ecosystem smart contract built on the Stacks blockchain. This contract provides a robust framework for managing game assets, player registrations, score tracking, and reward distribution.

## Features

### 1. Game Asset Management

- Create and mint unique game assets as NFTs
- Store detailed metadata for each game asset
- Transfer game assets between players
- Track total number of game assets

### 2. Player Management

- Player registration with entry fee
- Leaderboard tracking
- Score updating
- Reward distribution based on performance

### 3. Access Control

- Whitelist-based admin management
- Secure function access controls
- Principal validation mechanisms

## Contract Components

### Error Constants

The contract defines multiple error constants to handle various error scenarios:

- Authorization errors
- Game asset validation errors
- Fund-related errors
- Leaderboard and registration errors

### Key Data Structures

- **Game Asset NFT**: Custom non-fungible token with metadata
- **Leaderboard**: Tracks player scores, games played, and total rewards
- **Admin Whitelist**: Manages authorized game administrators

## Main Functions

### Administration

- `add-game-admin`: Add new game administrators
- `initialize-game`: Configure game parameters like entry fee and max leaderboard entries

### Asset Management

- `mint-game-asset`: Create new game asset NFTs with custom metadata
- `transfer-game-asset`: Transfer game assets between players

### Player Interactions

- `register-player`: Players can register for the game
- `update-player-score`: Update player performance
- `distribute-bitcoin-rewards`: Distribute rewards to top-performing players

## Key Validation Mechanisms

### Input Validation

- String length checks
- Principal safety checks
- Score and fee range validations
- Admin authorization checks

## Reward System

- Rewards calculated based on player scores
- Supports Bitcoin reward distribution
- Configurable reward calculation logic

## Security Considerations

- Whitelist-based admin access
- Strict input validation
- Transfer and balance checks
- Secure reward distribution mechanism

## Usage Requirements

- Stacks blockchain environment
- Initial admin (contract deployer) set up
- Proper configuration of game parameters

## Deployment Steps

1. Deploy the contract
2. Initial admin set up is automatic (contract deployer becomes first admin)
3. Use `initialize-game` to set entry fee and leaderboard parameters
4. Add additional admins using `add-game-admin`
5. Mint game assets
6. Allow player registrations

## Example Workflow

1. Admin initializes game configuration
2. Admin mints game assets
3. Players register and pay entry fee
4. Gameplay occurs with score tracking
5. Admin updates player scores
6. Rewards distributed based on performance

## Potential Improvements

- Implement more advanced leaderboard sorting
- Add more complex reward calculation mechanisms
- Enhance NFT metadata capabilities
- Implement more granular access controls

## Error Handling

The contract provides granular error codes for different failure scenarios, allowing for precise error tracking and debugging.

## Limitations

- Maximum leaderboard entries configurable (default 50)
- Score range limited (0-10000)
- Entry fee has min/max constraints
